/* Functions can be values too! You can’t directly write a function as a value, 
but you can pass a function’s name to the meta.get-function() function to get it as a value.
Once you have a function value, you can pass it to the meta.call() function to call it. 
This is useful for writing higher-order functions that call other functions.*/
